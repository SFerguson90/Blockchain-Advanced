### Purpose of Exercise
The purpose of this exercise was to create my own blockchain and get it up and running. This was done using Geth & Puppeth tools obtained through their respective websites. Two nodes were created using a Proof of Work concept, and were run in seperate terminals to communicate with one another and run the blockchain.

Wallets were also derived, using simple terminal commands. By providing a mneumonic key, the generator was able to create seperate wallets for users to store cryptocurrencies. 

### Technologies Used
* PuppEth
* gEth
* Terminal Commands
